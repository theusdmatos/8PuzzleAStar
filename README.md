# 8PuzzleAStar

8Puzzle is basically a frame area separated into 3x3 grids containing 8 tiles and one void grid. The tiles are marked in some way so as they can be identified. The tiles are mostly numbered from 1 to 8. We are given with an initial configuration of the tiles. A desired final configuration is also given. We have to reach the final state by sliding the tiles using the empty grid present.

Solving the 8 puzzle using A* (a star) algorithm. Various heuristics were used and the short comings of each were listed. An improvement in the existing Manhattan distance heuristic is implemented.
